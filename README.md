# Horoscope-website

My first website that was written using Python. The site was created as a pinning module in which I learned how to edit text files via Python and learned a few tags from HTML.

Go to the folder with the files and enter the following command in the console:
```sh
python generate_index.py
```

Then open index.html in browser
