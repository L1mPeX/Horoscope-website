# Horoscope-website

Horoscope website. A random prediction for that day is output for each download.

My first website written in Python. The site was created as a pinning module, in which I learned how to edit text files using Python and learned a few tags from HTML.

Go to the folder with the files and enter the following command in the console:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then you can start server:
```sh
python server.py
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080/` in browser
